                 Time complexity is a measure of the computational resources (time) an algorithm or program requires to solve a problem as a function of
                        the problem's input size. It quantifies how the running time of an algorithm grows with the size of the input.

                Time complexity is a concept in computer science that measures the computational efficiency of an algorithm. It quantifies the amount of
                 time an algorithm takes to complete its task as a function of the size of the input data. In simpler terms, time complexity tells us
                            how the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the problem it's solving increases.

                 of data at the lowest level. It involves performing various operations (e.g., shifting, masking, setting, clearing) on the binary
                                             digits (0s and 1s) that represent data in computer memory.

                 recursion breaks it down into smaller, similar subproblems. Each subproblem is solved by applying the same algorithm, and the solutions
                                                                are combined to solve the original problem.

                An array is a fundamental data structure in computer programming used to store a collection of elements of the same data type. It
                  provides a way to organize and access data in a linear, ordered manner. Arrays are widely used in programming for tasks like
                                 storing and manipulating data, and they are available in most programming languages.

                     used to represent and solve systems of linear equations, perform transformations in graphics and computer graphics, and
                                       conduct data analysis in statistics, among other applications.

                A linked list is a linear data structure used in computer science and programming to organize and store a collection of elements called nodes.
                      Unlike arrays, linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node in a linked list contains both the
                          data element and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. This "link" between nodes is how linked
                                                            lists derive their name and structure.

            <b>
                A doubly linked list is a type of linked list data structure in which each node contains data and two references (or pointers): one that points
                    to the next node in the sequence and another that points to the previous node. This bidirectional connectivity allows for easy traversal
                                                      in both directions, from the beginning to the end and vice versa.

        <pre>
            <b>
                A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list data structure in which the last node of the list points back to the first node, forming
                   a closed loop. In other words, the "next" reference of the last node points to the head of the list, creating a continuous cycle. Circular
                                      linked lists have no real "end," and you can continuously traverse through the list.

                                 solutions to subproblems, which reduces redundant computation and improves overall efficiency.
